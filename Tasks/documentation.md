Introduction:
As we know GIT is a version control system used for managing and tracking the changes in source code. For people together working on software it is helpful. Now since GIT is free and open source why GITHUB. Github is a platform where we showcase out git repos online.Simply told GitHub is a platform built on Git to help the developers to contribute to code repositories easily and with transparency. 

Prerequisites:
Things needed to know before using GtHub are basic commands in Git like add, push, clone, commit, we should also have a GitHub account. We should also have Git downloaded in the pc. 

Installation and Setup Details:
   First to use Github we need to about Git. So install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads. Then create an account in GitHub from https://github.com/. then we have to let GitHub configure in our pc i.e. locally. We did it in VS Code we can do it by command prompt also.
   git config --global user.name "NAME"
   git config --global user.email "MAILID"   (here name and mail id should math the github link name and mail id)
   Now git is there in your PC and also GitHub is configured locally so that whatever changes we made locally can be put in github through small steps and we can also get the source code easily to our local PC.

Why GitHuB:
   Firstly it is open and online we can simplyfy the collabaration made by a group of people to edit, change and also add code. It helps us, the developers to work without any big conflicts since it is accessavle with internet. we can also become visible, known to people through our works, we will be recognised and we can collaborate with people. We have a proof that someone has done it i.e. transparency. It hepls to find many projects to give us idea on how everything works.

How to use:
   GitHub is one of the most easily understood to work on.
   Firstly, we can fork other repos to work on ourselves then clone it locally and make changes and also put pull requests to send back our code and data to become a collaborator.
   We can commit the work and push the new code and data. We can chat i.e. issues and discussions for managing feedback and errors we can again change our code to pull requests. 

Real-World Use Cases: 
    Git is literally the moat used version control software in world and GitHub being the garage of the engine is used for, colaborating, contributing, and using many things. Such inccludes, 
    Building new ideas apps, websites and manymore. 
    tracking and using data of real life projects such as dams, NGO's, Buildings, which give transperency.
    Publishing new code, data used to save from plagrism and made our data known to everyone. 
    Running open source competitions like GSSoC and many.
    Collaborating on real life projects and make it known to everyone.

Some History Related to It:
     The GitHub service was started in February 2008. Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018, expanding its ecosystem.  (from wikipedia)

My Interest:
    As someone passionate about open-source in the recent times,I found GitHub helpful in helping me know about the open-source world. GitHub is where i have started collaborating, co-operating and becoming known to the world. GitHub is the place where i have started findong more projects that are impactful to the society.

Why GitHub better than others
    Personally I found GitHub to be User-friendly and better to collaborate on. With millions of repos which are made free it is where we find many projects for collaboration and to be seen. I found it easier to use because of Copilot and VSCode being integrated in Github
