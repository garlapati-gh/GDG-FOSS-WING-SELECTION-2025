**Why do you want to join GDG FOSS Wing?**: 
Before GSSoC, I used to think that open source was difficult, time-consuming, and even boring, especially after my early experiences with Linux. But after contributing to GSSoC had made me understand that open source is something not only interesting but also collaborative, and empowering. I understood that open-source is a place where our interests are multiplied, our work is appreciated and open to the world. I have started doing open-source recently after I was taken as a contibutor in GSSoC and with help from my freinds made me understand its something bigger and better than I have thought so, and I feel that GDG FOSS Wing is the perfect place for me to continue this and improve my skills, and move forward in the open source world. 

**Any other wing(s) you have applie to?**: 
I have applied to Content, Creative and Outreach wings in the non-technical field.

**Are you interested in participating in any of the global open-source programs like GSoC, LFX, Outreachy, SOB etc? If yes, mention it**:
Yes, after contributing in GSSoC and understanding the Open source world, I am eager to participate in many more bigger open-source programs like SOB, Outreachy and many more.I am excited to take my journey in open source world further.
